Description: Radio livestream to ogg/mp3 tool
 This script handles mp3 files (-ripped by streamripper), fades them in and
 out. It sets stream tags: artist, title and your own decided genre.
 If you have songs you do not like, move the ripped file to the dontlike/ folder,
 so fadecut will no longer convert this song, if it was read on the livestream.
 All processed files of fadecut are in new/ folder. The original files from
 streamripper are in the orig/ folder after processing.
