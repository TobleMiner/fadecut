--- Overview -------------------------------------------------------------------
 This script handle mp3 files (-ripped by streamripper), fade in and            
 out. It set stream tags: artist, title and your own decided genre.             
 If you have songs you do not like, move the ripped file to dontlike/ folder,
 so fadecut will no longer convert this song, if it was read on the livestream. 
 All processed files of fadecut are in new/ folder. The original files from     
 streamripper are in the orig/ folder after processing.
