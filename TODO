# --- notes --------------------------------------------------------------------
to change tags you may use lltag (writes only id3v1 tags):
lltag --yes -g SwissPop -c "Radio Swiss Pop" *.mp3

to change filenames according to tags:
lltag --rename "%a_-_%t" --rename-min --rename-sep _ --yes *.mp3

to change filenames with iso-8859 umlaut to utf8:
convmv -f iso-8859-15 -t utf8 -r *.mp3 --notest

another command line tagging tool, which reads and writes also id3v2:
(and it is able to write lyrics and pictures into the files)
(not useful for reading tags)
* eyeD3 - displays and manipulates id3-tags on mp3 files
