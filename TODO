# --- 0.2.0 release ------------------------------------------------------------
* marco Change ${vars} to $vars
* marco Testframework:
	  Take testing upstream code directly from git,
	  add more tests.
	  Testframework executed by dpkg-buildpackage.
* marco stats, processed songs per hour

# --- later --------------------------------------------------------------------
* tinu  change to getopt(1) to be able to parse --long-options
* tinu  cross correlation with well known ad files
* tinu  maybe we could use ffmpeg instead of sox/lame 
* team  statistics reporting
* team  discuss about sense of DOUBLEDIR, maybe not needed anymore
* tinu  write filename to statslog.csv and note errors
* tinu  wishlist: put a file in $fadecuthome with a list of artist/titles
          start fadecut with special option (-w for example) and fadecut
          will rip/process only files which are on the wishlist.
          this should work with many fadecut processes in parallel, to scan on
          many internet-radio stations in parallel to complete the wishlist as
          fast as possible
